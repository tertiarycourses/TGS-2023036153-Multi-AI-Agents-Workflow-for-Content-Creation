# Labs — Multi AI Agents Workflow for Content Creation (Claude Edition)

TGS-2023036153 · 15 labs · build an AI marketing team, then run five campaigns with it.

## The scenario

Rachel Goh founded Horizon Wealth Planning in 2010. Fifteen years and 1,200
clients later, almost every new client still comes through a referral — and
referrals are slowing. Younger Singaporeans look for money help on LinkedIn,
Facebook, YouTube and in their inbox, and Horizon is invisible there.

Rachel has a website, three planners, a part-time marketer (Jun Wei) and
S$4,000 a month. She wants 40 booked free chats a month by March 2027
— without hiring a marketing team. So you will build her one, made of AI
agents, with Claude and Claude Code:

  Marketing Team Lead  — plans, assigns, checks, hands to a person
  Growth Strategist    — research, positioning, briefs, storyboards
  Content Creator      — posts, newsletter, scripts, page copy
  Creative Designer    — images, thumbnails, the video
  Website Designer     — landing pages, published and QA-checked
  Growth Analyst       — personas, cadence, results, weekly report

First you form the team: instructions, skills and connectors for each agent.
Then the team runs five campaigns together. Financial content is regulated,
so a person approves every piece before it goes out. The data is fictitious
but consistent, and every email address resolves to your own inbox.

## Before you start

- The Claude desktop app on a Pro plan or above, signed in with your claude.ai account. Every lab says whether to use **Claude** or **Claude Code** — both are in the app.
- Installed by the trainer before class (you never type commands): Node.js, Python and ffmpeg, which run the approval gate and the video.
- A personal Google account for Drive and Gmail; optional LinkedIn, Facebook Page and YouTube accounts for live publishing.
- One working folder, `horizon-studio/`, from Lab 1 to Lab 15 — ready-made in this pack with every lab's data in `data/`. Choose it in Claude (Project or folder → Add folder); do not create one.
- `.md` files are plain text for Claude to read; each has a `.pdf` twin with the same name for you to read.

## Safety

Use only this lab's synthetic data and your own accounts. Never paste a real API key, password, token or client data into a prompt or a file. Every email address in the data must resolve to your own inbox. Nothing is published or sent without a person approving that exact version.
