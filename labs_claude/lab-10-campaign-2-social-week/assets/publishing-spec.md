# Publishing spec — the human approval gate (Lab 10)

Nothing reaches LinkedIn, Facebook or YouTube unless a **person** approved
that exact version.

## Content files
One file per item: `content/<channel>/<week-or-issue>/<id>.md`

```
---
id: li-w01-01
channel: linkedin            # linkedin | facebook | youtube | newsletter
title: Know your number in 30 minutes
link: https://tertiarycourses.github.io/TGS-2023036153-Multi-AI-Agents-Workflow-for-Content-Creation/?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=know-your-number
video: content/video/ep01/ep01.mp4   # youtube only
tags: retirement, cpf, planning      # youtube only
---
The post text (for YouTube: the video description).
```

## review/approvals.csv
`id,channel,file,sha256,status,submitted_by,approver,approved_at,notes`
- status: pending | approved | changes | rejected
- sha256: hash of the content file (plus the video file for YouTube).

## Scripts (Node 22, no packages)
| Script | Who runs it | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| scripts/submit.mjs <file> | agents | Adds or refreshes a **pending** row with the file's hash |
| typing "approved <id> by <name>" (or "changes <id>: why") in Claude Code | a **person** | Approves (or sends back) the CURRENT version: records approver, time and hash. A hook reads the person's own message, so an agent cannot approve. |
| scripts/publish.mjs <id> [--live] | agents or people | Dry run by default: prints the exact request, sends nothing. With --live: refuses unless the row is approved AND the hash still matches; refuses an id already in review/publish-log.csv (no double posts); logs the post id. |

## The hook (Claude Code, .claude/settings.json)
A PreToolUse hook on Bash, Edit and Write runs scripts/gate-hook.mjs:
- blocks any agent that tries to approve (only people approve, by typing in the chat);
- blocks agent edits to review/approvals.csv;
- blocks `publish.mjs ... --live` unless the item is approved and unchanged.
It blocks with exit code 2 and a reason the agent can read.

## The APIs
**LinkedIn** — POST https://api.linkedin.com/rest/posts
Headers: Authorization: Bearer <token>, LinkedIn-Version: <YYYYMM>,
X-Restli-Protocol-Version: 2.0.0, Content-Type: application/json.
Body: author (urn:li:person:...), commentary, visibility PUBLIC,
distribution {feedDistribution MAIN_FEED}, lifecycleState PUBLISHED.
Needs the w_member_social permission. The post id comes back in the
x-restli-id header.

**Facebook Page** — POST https://graph.facebook.com/<version>/<page-id>/feed
with message, link and a Page access token (pages_manage_posts,
pages_read_engagement).

**YouTube** — resumable upload:
POST https://www.googleapis.com/upload/youtube/v3/videos?uploadType=resumable&part=snippet,status
with snippet (title, description, tags, categoryId 27) and status
(privacyStatus **private**, selfDeclaredMadeForKids false), then PUT the
video bytes to the returned Location. Get an access token from the refresh
token at https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token. Uploads from an unaudited API
project stay private — a person makes the video public in YouTube Studio.

**Newsletter** — no API. Created as files and Gmail drafts (Lab 11).
