## The story so far

Rachel sketches the team on a whiteboard: a Lead and five specialists. Each needs a clear job, and a clear line it must never cross — this is a regulated firm.

## Your goal

A team is a set of clear jobs. Write each agent's instructions once — its job, what it reads, what it delivers and what it must never do — and every campaign can call on it.

## You'll build

.claude/agents/: growth-strategist, content-creator, creative-designer, website-designer, growth-analyst

## What is in this folder

> **.md or .pdf?** A `.md` file (Markdown) is plain text that Claude reads. Every `.md` here has a `.pdf` twin with the same name — open the PDF to read it yourself.

- `assets/role-specs.md`
- `assets/team-org-chart.md`
- `solution/` — reference files from the verified build (each `.md` with its `.pdf`)
- `prompts.md` / `prompts.pdf` — every prompt, ready to paste
- `evidence/checklist.md` / `checklist.pdf` — what to capture as proof

## Step by step

1. **New session** — Left sidebar: click + next to horizon-studio. Click the session title at the top and rename it "Lab 2". Run all of this lab's prompts in it.
2. **Read the roles** — Open role-specs.md: one Lead and five specialists, each with a job, skills, connectors and limits.
3. **Write the instructions** — Copy and paste Prompt A. It builds the five specialists from the charter; extra ideas stay in team-design.md.
4. **See the team** — After the five files appear in .claude/agents/, copy and paste Prompt B. The Lead is not a file — it is you, in this session.
5. **Read one closely** — Open .claude/agents/content-creator.md. Is the "Never" section strict enough for a regulated firm?
6. **Meet the team** — After the list shows five agents, copy and paste Prompt C. Each agent introduces itself in one line — in its own context.
7. **Tighten one** — Change one instruction you disagree with and save it. It is your team.

## The prompts

### PROMPT A — Claude Code: five subagents

> Read data/role-specs.md. Create five project
> subagents in .claude/agents/ — growth-strategist,
> content-creator, creative-designer, website-designer
> and growth-analyst. Each file has:
> - frontmatter: name; a description that says when to
>   use it; tools; model (opus for the strategist,
>   sonnet for the others)
> - a body with: the job, what it reads, what it
>   delivers, the connectors it may use, what it must
>   never do, and how it reports back.
> No skills line yet — we add skills in Lab 3.

### PROMPT B — Claude Code: see the team

> List the subagents in .claude/agents/. For each,
> show the file name, the name, the one-line
> description and the model, in a table. Then confirm
> there are five, and that none of them is the
> Marketing Team Lead — the Lead is this session.
> If any other file is there, list it and ask me
> before moving it to _archive/.

### PROMPT C — Claude Code: meet the team

> Use each of the five subagents once, in parallel.
> Ask each: "In one line, who are you, and what is
> the first thing you would do for Horizon's goal of
> 40 booked chats a month?" Show me the five answers
> in a table.

## Check your work

- [ ] Five files exist in .claude/agents/, one per specialist.
- [ ] Each has a name, a "use when" description, tools and a model.
- [ ] Your session acts as the Marketing Team Lead.
- [ ] Five agents answered, each in its own context.
- [ ] Every agent has a "never" rule that blocks publishing.
- [ ] You changed one instruction and can say why.

## If it goes wrong

- **A subagent never runs** — Name it: "use the growth-strategist subagent" or @agent-growth-strategist.
- **There are more than five files** — Files such as marketing-team-lead, compliance-reviewer or community-manager come from an earlier run. Let Prompt B move them to _archive/: the Lead is your session, and the fin-compliance skill (Lab 3) does the compliance review.
- **/agents says the wizard has been removed** — Expected — it only prints a reminder now. Paste Prompt B to list the team, or open .claude/agents/ in the Files panel (the folder icon, top right).

## Stretch

- Add a sixth agent, community-manager, that drafts replies to comments — and decide what it must never do.

> **Why it matters:** Clear jobs beat clever prompts. An agent that knows what it must never do is safer than one that is merely told to be careful.

## Next

Lab 3 — Give Each Agent Its Skills. Keep what you built — the next lab starts from it.

## Safety

Use only this lab's synthetic data and your own accounts. Never paste a real API key, password, token or client data into a prompt or a file. Every email address in the data must resolve to your own inbox. Nothing is published or sent without a person approving that exact version.
