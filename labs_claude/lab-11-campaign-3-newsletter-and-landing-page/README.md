## The story so far

The Sunny Sunday email books chats most cheaply. November's issue promotes a new landing page for the free checklist — and must reach only the 31 people who opted in.

## Your goal

The Sunny Sunday email books chats most cheaply — if it is right and reaches only people who said yes. This issue promotes a new landing page for the Money Check-up Checklist.

## You'll build

the November newsletter, its recipient list, the landing page published, and Gmail drafts — shown as artifacts, with a Word copy of each

## What is in this folder

> **.md or .pdf?** A `.md` file (Markdown) is plain text that Claude reads. Every `.md` here has a `.pdf` twin with the same name — open the PDF to read it yourself.

- `assets/newsletter-brief.md`
- `assets/newsletter-spec.md`
- `assets/landing-page-brief.md`
- `assets/site-brief.md`
- `assets/checklist-items.md`
- `assets/subscribers.csv`
- `prompts.md` / `prompts.pdf` — every prompt, ready to paste
- `evidence/checklist.md` / `checklist.pdf` — what to capture as proof

## Step by step

1. **New session** — Left sidebar: click + next to horizon-studio. Click the session title at the top and rename it "Lab 11". Run all of this lab's prompts in it.
2. **Start the campaign** — Copy and paste Prompt A.
3. **Approve the words** — Review the issue in the artifact (or open the review email and click its link). Click Approve or Request changes, then paste the copied line into the chat.
4. **Publish the page** — The website designer runs page-qa and publishes web/checklist/ as a Claude artifact.
5. **Check the list** — Only people with consent = yes and unsubscribed = no are on the recipient list.
6. **Create the drafts** — After the page is published and the list checked, copy and paste Prompt B.
7. **Send one test** — Send only the draft addressed to yourself, and read it on your phone.

## The prompts

### PROMPT A — Claude Code: the newsletter team

> Create an agent team for the November Sunny
> Sunday email (data/newsletter-brief.md,
> data/newsletter-spec.md) and its landing page
> (data/landing-page-brief.md). Spawn three teammates:
> content-creator, website-designer and growth-analyst.
> - content-creator: issue.md (id nl-2026-11) with
>   newsletter, and the landing-page copy.
> - website-designer: web/checklist/index.html with
>   lead-magnet, web-design and landing-page from the
>   approved copy; page-qa.
> - growth-analyst: recipients.csv and excluded.csv
>   from data/subscribers.csv.
> Before you start, ask me how I will review: in the
> artifact, or by email (then ask for the approver's
> address). You check everything, then submit
> nl-2026-11 and publish the issue as an artifact,
> laid out as the email, with the counts of
> recipients and excluded, an Approve button and a
> Request changes box that copy the exact line for me
> to paste in the chat. If I chose email, send ONE
> review email to the approver with Gmail: the
> artifact link and what passed the checks. Only
> after I approve, build newsletter.html and .txt and
> publish the page as an artifact.
> Write for a business owner, in plain English: no
> codes, IDs, file names or line numbers; start with
> what it means and what I do next. Save a Word copy
> (.docx) of each result.

### PROMPT B — Claude Code: Gmail drafts

> Using the Gmail connector, create a DRAFT of
> newsletter.html for each address in recipients.csv,
> plus one draft addressed to me only. Send nothing.
> Publish a report as an artifact: how many drafts, how many
> people were excluded, and why, in a table.

## Ask about the result

Once a result opens, type any of these in the chat to get its meaning. Ask until it makes sense to you — then decide.

- "Explain the email in three sentences. What do we want readers to do?"
- "Who was left off the mailing list, and why?"
- "What did the landing-page check look at, and did it pass?"

## Check your work

- [ ] Three specialists worked on the campaign; the Lead checked all.
- [ ] You reviewed nl-2026-11 in the artifact or by email and approved it in the chat before the build.
- [ ] The landing page passed page-qa and is published.
- [ ] The recipient list holds 31 people; 9 are excluded, with reasons.
- [ ] The email has unsubscribe, address and disclaimer.
- [ ] Drafts only — nothing was sent to the list.

## If it goes wrong

- **The build started before approval** — Tell the Lead the build waits for review/approvals.csv to say approved.

## Stretch

- Ask for two subject lines to A/B test, with a reason for each.

> **Why it matters:** Consent decides who gets mail — not the agent and not the deadline. Marketing to people who did not opt in breaks the PDPA.

## Next

Lab 12 — Campaign 4: The YouTube Explainer. Keep what you built — the next lab starts from it.

## Safety

Use only this lab's synthetic data and your own accounts. Never paste a real API key, password, token or client data into a prompt or a file. Every email address in the data must resolve to your own inbox. Nothing is published or sent without a person approving that exact version.
