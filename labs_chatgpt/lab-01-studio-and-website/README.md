## The story so far

October 2026. Rachel has a website and a goal: 40 booked chats a month by March. She has no marketing team. Before you hire one made of agents, give it a home — shared rules, shared facts — and open your own copy of Horizon's website.

## Your goal

Before anyone builds a team, the team needs a home: one folder of shared facts and rules, and your own copy of Horizon's website — the one every post links to.

## You'll build

the Horizon Marketing project, horizon-studio/ with AGENTS.md, and your own copy of the site running at http://localhost:8080/

## Horizon's website

You work on your own copy in `web/site/` of your folder; Labs 8 and 9 add to it. Ask "Start my website" to open it at http://localhost:8080/ — every post links there. The public site is only for looking at; nobody changes it.

- **Your website (the link in every post):** http://localhost:8080/
- **Public site (to look at only):** https://tertiarycourses.github.io/TGS-2023036153-Multi-AI-Agents-Workflow-for-Content-Creation/

## Folder structure

## What is in this folder

> **.md or .pdf?** A `.md` file (Markdown) is plain text that Claude reads. Every `.md` here has a `.pdf` twin with the same name — open the PDF to read it yourself.

- `assets/horizon-site.html`
- `assets/team-charter.md`
- `assets/business-brief.md`
- `assets/brand.md`
- `assets/facts-2026.md`
- `assets/compliance-checklist.md`
- `solution/` — reference files from the verified build (each `.md` with its `.pdf`)
- `prompts.md` / `prompts.pdf` — every prompt, ready to paste
- `evidence/checklist.md` / `checklist.pdf` — what to capture as proof

## Step by step

1. **Choose the folder** — In Codex create a local project and choose labs_chatgpt/horizon-studio. It is ready-made — do not create one.
2. **Make the Project** — In ChatGPT create the Project "Horizon Marketing" with the charter, brand, facts and compliance files. Copy and paste Prompt A as its instructions.
3. **Plan your team** — In Codex, copy and paste Prompt B. Answer as Horizon's owner and pick your team — keep the six charter roles. It is a plan only: Lab 2 builds the agents.
4. **Write the charter** — After Codex saves data/team-design.md, copy and paste Prompt C. Open AGENTS.md — every agent reads it.
5. **Open the website** — Ask: "Start my website." It opens at http://localhost:8080/ — your own copy of Horizon's website; every post links to it. Check the calculator shows S$693,138.

## The prompts

### PROMPT A — ChatGPT Project: instructions

> You support Horizon Wealth Planning's AI marketing
> team. Use the project files: team-charter.md for who
> does what, brand.md for the voice and look,
> facts-2026.md for every number, and
> compliance-checklist.md before anything is shown to
> a person. Never publish or send anything.

### PROMPT B — Codex: plan your team

> Act as a marketing consultant. Interview me, the
> owner of Horizon Wealth Planning, to plan my AI
> marketing team. Ask one question at a time and wait
> for my answer: my goal, what success looks like by
> March 2027, who we want to reach, which channels we
> use, how much we publish each week, and who approves
> before anything goes out.
> Then list 8 to 10 team members I could have,
> numbered, each with a one-line job. Include the six
> roles in data/team-charter.md and mark the ones you
> recommend. Wait for me to choose.
> Save my answers and my chosen team, with each
> member's job, to data/team-design.md. This is a
> plan only: do not create any agent files yet.

### PROMPT C — Codex: the charter

> Read data/team-charter.md, data/team-design.md
> and data/business-brief.md. Write AGENTS.md for this
> studio in four sections — What this is, The team,
> Rules, Files — under 60 lines. The team is the one
> I chose in data/team-design.md. Rules: every number
> comes from data/facts-2026.md; every piece passes
> fact-check and fin-compliance; nothing is published
> or sent without a person's approval (the one
> exception: a review email to the approver); anything
> shown to me is in plain English for a business owner,
> with no codes, IDs, file names or line numbers.
> In Files, add two lines:
> - Our copy of the site, which we edit: web/site/.
>   "Start my website" runs scripts/serve-site.mjs in
>   the background and opens http://localhost:8080/
> - Every post links to http://localhost:8080/ with
>   UTM tags, never to a claude.ai artifact link.

## Check your work

- [ ] The Horizon Marketing project holds the four files and the instructions.
- [ ] data/team-design.md holds your answers and the team you chose, with the six charter roles in it — and no agent files yet.
- [ ] AGENTS.md has the four sections and is under 60 lines.
- [ ] Its rules name the facts sheet, the two checks and the human approval.
- [ ] AGENTS.md names your copy of the site and the link every post points to.
- [ ] Your website opens at http://localhost:8080/; the calculator shows S$693,138.

## If it goes wrong

- **The website does not open** — Say: "Start my website again." If the page still does not load, say: "Open web/site/index.html in my web browser."
- **It created agent files already** — Not yet — say "Move everything in agents/ to _archive/. We build the team in Lab 2." The plan in data/team-design.md is all Lab 1 needs.

## Stretch

- Ask: "Read web/site/index.html. In five bullets: who it is for, the offer, the main call to action, what the calculator does, and the disclaimer."
- Ask for a one-paragraph summary of the site from the point of view of a busy 35-year-old parent.

> **Why it matters:** Shared context first, agents second. Every agent you add later starts from these files, so a wrong rule here is wrong everywhere.

## Next

Lab 2 — Form the Team: Instructions for Each Agent. Keep what you built — the next lab starts from it.

## Safety

Use only this lab's synthetic data and your own accounts. Never paste a real API key, password, token or client data into a prompt or a file — tokens live only in .env. Every email address in the data must resolve to your own inbox. Nothing is published or sent without a person approving that exact version.
